# Stable Diffusion 

Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion model that is capable of generating detailed images from text descriptions. It can also be used for tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, text-to-image and image-to-image translations.

Due to its powerful ability to generate images based on different types of prompts (text, image, etc.) actually only our imagination limits us where this tool can be used. It can fasten or enhance our ability to create more engaging content for our customers or users in general. Even if youâ€™re a creative who sucks with a creative block you can use generated images to get inspired and overcome the stagnation. We encourage you to do a unique art with usage of Stable Diffusion models or first drafts for your artistic (or everyday) journey.
